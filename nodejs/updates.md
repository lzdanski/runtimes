## March 18, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.2-20160315-1257

This release of the buildpack moves the default IBM SDK for Node.js runtime from version 4.3.0 to 4.3.2. It also includes IBM SDK for Node.js versions 0.10.43, 0.12.12, and 4.3.1. Use these recent Node.js versions to pick up fixes for several security vulnerabilities.

## March 4, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.1-20160222-1123

This release of the buildpack moves the default IBM SDK for Node.js runtime from version 4.2.4 to 4.3.0. It also includes IBM SDK for Node.js versions 0.10.42, 0.12.10, and 4.2.6. Use these recent Node.js versions to pick up fixes for several security vulnerabilities.

## February 4, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.0-20160125-1224

This release is fully synchronized with the [Cloud Foundry community Node.js](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack) buildpack. In addition to community changes, modifications were made to certain defaults, along with optimizations to reduce staging time and updates to the App Management feature.

* Buildpack updates:

  * Node.js v4.2.4 (IBM SDK for Node.js Version 4) is now the default runtime on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, replacing v0.12.9. This change might cause your application to behave differently if a particular version is not specified for your application. To learn how to specify a version of Node.js for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application, see [Node.js runtime](index.html) documentation.

  * NODE_ENV is now set to *production* by default. This change will cause some node dependencies to behave differently. For example, the Express framework will no longer return stacktraces in the web browser for faulty endpoints, but instead displays *Internal Server Error*. When NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION is set to *true*, NPM will set NODE_ENV to *production* for subshell scripts in the npm install phase only. This function allows users to set NODE_ENV to another value like *development* for application runtime. For clarity, npm scripts will see the message **NODE_ENV=production**.

  * A Bug-fix to the Monitoring and Analytics service is included.

* Caching updates:

  * If cache is disabled (NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false) the buildpack will not attempt to cache any modules/components. Previously this setting made it so that the cache is not popped, but it would still cache the installed modules for future deploys. Now, it will not pop the cache or attempt to store any cache.

  * Bower_components are cached by default in addition to node_modules.

* Other updates:

  * Added Helpful warnings for missing dependencies like gulp, bower, and angular.

  * The detect script is updated with buildpack version information.

  * The clustering recommendation (WEB_CONCURRENCY) initially introduced by community is removed as memory determination was inaccurate on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.


## December 16, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.8-20151209-1403 and v3.0beta-20151211-2041

This release of the Node.js buildpack comes with two versions, v2.8 and v3.0beta. Both these versions include the following changes:

A Bug-fix to Monitoring and Analytics service
The inclusion of a cached runtime for IBM SDK for Node.js v4.2.3.0, v4.2.2.0, v1.2.0.8 and v1.2.0.7, which are based on community versions Node.js v4.2.3, v4.2.2, v0.12.9 and v0.12.8.
In addition, in v3.0beta the default Node.js runtime is changed to v4.2.3.

IBM Node.js buildpack v3.0beta is now released as a non-default buildpack on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} with Node.js v4.2.3 as the default runtime. To ensure that your apps and services will continue to work on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, push your application with the beta version of the buildpack. After 30 days or longer, v3 will be made the default buildpack.

To push your application with v3.0beta:
* Use "-b" option in your 'cf push' command:

```
        cf push -b sdk-for-nodejs-v3beta
```
{: codeblock}

* Or use the "buildpack" option in your manifest.yml file:

```
        buildpack: sdk-for-nodejs-v3beta
```
{: codeblock}

This change to the default runtime will not affect your application if you configured a specific version of Node.js in your application's package.json.

**Note:** You can always specify the version of Node.js to run your application by using the engines.node entry in your package.json as explained in [Available versions](index.html#available_versions).

## November 23, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.7-20151118-1003

With 2.7, version 4.2.1.0 of the IBM SDK for Node.js (based on Node v4.2.1 LTS) is included. It is not the default yet, but can be specified for use. **Note:** This version replaces the open source build that was previously available. We also made some small bug fixes to our service extension framework.

## October 19, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.6.1-20151015-1326

Node.js v2.6.1 introduces a bug fix to the [StrongPM app management handler](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/10/15/strongloop-devops-on-bluemix/), and a more consistent NPM version.

## October 15, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.6-20151006-1309
